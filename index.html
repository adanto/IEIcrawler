Hip-hop, soul, funk, reggae, dub, ska and latin music are all represented by household names and newcomers alike, across three days and three stages at Brussels' Tour &amp; Taxis centre. Well into its third decade of contemporary carnivals, Couleur Caf&#233; is known for its great food and even better bars &#8211; the famous Mamafoufou has been joined by loads more bar/club venues that get every bit as pumping as the stages themselves. Artists of the calibre of Faithless, Jimmy Cliff, Wu-Tang Clan and Busta Rhymes have all been part of the fun over the last few years, and it doesn't seem like Couleur Caf&#233; will be letting up any time soon.</p><p>

        Name: AFROPUNK FEST Paris 2016</h3><p>AFROPUNK FEST Paris is the European edition of Brooklyn's world famous festival. A cultural movement that brings those who feel like outsiders into the centre of an empowered community, Afro-Punk celebrates music, film, skate, and the value of individuals. In 2003, a seminal documentary that gave AFROPUNK its name highlighted a growing urban culture among the Black community. AFROPUNK became "a voice for the unwritten, unwelcome an unheard-of." Festivals have since sprung up in New York, Atlanta and Paris,&#160;all acting as focal-points for burgeoning Afro-Punk culture. The European event is a two-day festival incorporating urban and soul music, visual arts and much more.</p><p>

        Name: Electric Elephant 2016</h3><p>Starting life as Electric Chair &#8211; the monthly house, disco and electronica club night in Manchester &#8211; Electric Elephant has taken to the roots of the popular night and brought it to Croatia.

        Name: Paul van Dyk: The Politics of Dancing 3 Album Tour Brno</h3><p>To mark the release of his latest album, dance producer Paul van Dyk hits the road, bringing his A-game to the Czech Republic's second largest city, Brno. The DJ, having grown up behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, and starved of any free access to music, was overwhelmed when the wall finally came down in 1989, diving head first into this new wonder and becoming one of the definers of Berlin's techno scene.&#160; Now, his popularity and world-wide status is immense, leaving festivals and sold out shows in his wake, and he's back to do it all again next February.&#160;</p><p>
